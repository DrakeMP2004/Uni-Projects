# The goal is to escape from the maze. There are 5 mazes 
provided that you can test your algorithm on. 
# You are allowed 200 moves in the maze before you die. You will 
appear at some point in the maze but you don't know where. Each 
maze has exactly one exit.  
# Each maze is a 20x20 grid consisting of walls and spaces. The main 
method that reads in the data is provided (see Lab10 code below). 
The input reads in the maze structure from a series of 20 Strings, 
followed by two int co-ordinates, giving your X and Y positions in the 
20x20 maze.  

# All you need to do is complete the getMove() method, which takes in 
4 booleans representing if it's possible to move north, south, east 
and west (true means you can, false means there's a wall). 
# The program will print out the maze every time you make a step and 
then pause for 100ms. If you move into a wall, nothing happens but 
you lose a life. The program will terminate if you find the exit or lose 
all your lives.
