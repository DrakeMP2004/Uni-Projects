# In the glass bridge challenge in Squid Game there are n contestants 
who have to cross a glass bridge in order, according to their number. 
# There are 17 jump choices to be made to get across the bridge. A 
contestant can choose to either jump to the left or to the right. 
# Unknown to the participants, one side will collapse under their 
weight and lead to their elimination, while the other side is correct. 
# Participants have to be successful with a 50/50 guess to progress 
another step forwards and there are 17 steps in total. 

# Assume that every time any player makes a jump from any position 
into any other position, they have a 1% chance of just falling off the 
bridge by accident. Thus, nobody ever has a 100% chance of making 
it across. 
# Write a Monte Carlo simulation that calculates the % chance, to the 
nearest percent, that player n will survive. For example, when n is 5 
then the answer is 2%, because the 5th player has a 2% chance of 
surviving. The Monte Carlo simulation should take one parameter, 
namely n.
